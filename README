1 * Installation instructions
2 * Usage
----------------------------------

----------------------
 1. Installation
----------------------
Currently Login provides a Makefile for only UNIX-like systems.
You will need a version of g++ and also development files for SDL.
To check if you are good to go see if the sdl-config command works.

After you have those things done just change to the directory containing login and type:
 make
This will create a executable called login in the current directory if all goes well. To run it use:
./login

To install the program system wide in /usr/bin run the following command as ROOT:
make install

NOTE:The system wide program will be /usr/bin/login_game. Make sure you use login_game to start it. This is to prevent conflicts with the original login command.


----------------------
 2. Usage
----------------------
Once the program starts the following keys work:
 s - start/stop running the game of life
 r - randomly fill the grid. Works only when game is stopped.
 c - clears the grid. Works only when game is stopped.
 - - increase the speed of the game
 + - decrease the speed of the game
You can also you the mouse to set/unset any cell by clicking on it. This too works only when the game is stopped.
